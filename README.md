## Debloat Windows 11: Remove unnecessary Windows 11 22H2 programs

Run the .bat file, and let the magic happens.

Tested on Windows 11 22H2, Family and Pro, Build 22621.2428.

In order to make your own Sart Menu as you wish, make you own start2.bin as explain here: https://superuser.com/a/1690893/996827. Mine is like on the picture (Explorer and parameters).

A reboot is really recommanded at the end of the process in order to remove everything.

Enjoy!
